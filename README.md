# Cervical-Cancer-Prediction
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model for predicting cervical cancer.
Three algorithms were used in the project: XGBoost, AdaBoost, and CatBoost classifiers.
The model analyzes various factors related to cervical cancer, such as age, HPV test results, and cervical cytology, to provide predictions about the likelihood of cervical cancer.
Parameters and tuning methods were experimented with to optimize the performance of each model.
Once the models were trained and validated, their performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
The results were compared to determine which algorithm performed the best for predicting cervical cancer.
The final model could potentially be used to help healthcare professionals make more accurate predictions about the likelihood of cervical cancer and provide appropriate preventive measures to patients.
